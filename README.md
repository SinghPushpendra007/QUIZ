I created an interactive quiz using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that offers an engaging way to test knowledge. The HTML structure includes questions and answer options, while CSS enhances the visual appeal with stylish layouts and colors. JavaScript adds functionality, allowing users to select answers, receive instant feedback, and calculate their scores. This combination of technologies not only makes the quiz visually appealing but also ensures a smooth and enjoyable user experience, encouraging users to learn while having fun.
